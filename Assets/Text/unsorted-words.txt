Lobby of the Daily News Building, c. 1941
Lobby of the Daily News Building, c. 1941
The Daily News Building is a skyscraper in Manhattan, New York City. The original tower, completed on July 23, 1930, was designed by Raymond Hood and John Mead Howells in the Art Deco style; a similarly-styled expansion, designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, was completed in 1960. The 36-story tower, rising 476 feet (145 m), consists of a 14-story printing plant and an 18-story annex. There is a large carved-granite entrance leading to a rotunda lobby with a rotating painted globe (pictured). The Daily News' parent company, Tribune Media, sold the building in 1982, and the newspaper moved out entirely in 1995. SL Green Realty bought the building in 2003 and sold a partial ownership stake to Meritz Alternative Investment Management in 2021. When it opened, the building received mixed reviews and was described as having a utilitarian design. It is a National Historic Landmark and its exterior and lobby are designated city landmarks.

Amália Rodrigues	
Amália Rodrigues (23 July 1920 – 6 October 1999) was a Portuguese fado singer (fadista). Dubbed Rainha do Fado ('Queen of Fado'), she was instrumental in popularising the genre worldwide and travelled internationally throughout her career. She remains the best-selling Portuguese artist in history. This photograph shows Rodrigues performing at the Grand Gala du Disque Populaire, an annual Dutch gala for popular music, held in 1969 in Amsterdam.
